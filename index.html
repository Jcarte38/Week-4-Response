<title>The Rhetoric of the Image</title>

<body>
<p> Roland Barthes’ “Rhetoric of the Image” is a very detailed scholarly esoteric analysis of the language of images in photography.<br>
His style of communication and sharing information is obtuse, which is to say that it is indistinct and not easy to perceive. <br>
The three messages he mentions in his article are:</p>
<p>1. Linguistic message- which describes the elements of a scene through language.<br>
2. A coded iconic message<br>
3. Non coded conic message </p>
<p>The other two messages are not clearly defined in his lengthy article therefore it was inopportune to provide an example of them. </p>
